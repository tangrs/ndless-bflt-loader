		/* The .shlb section is a workaround for calling across
		   shared libraries. The automatically generated code veneers
		   don't seem to have their addresses relocated properly.

		   The workaround involves using the --wrap option in ld
		   to wrap library calls into our own code veneers which are
		   located in the data section and get relocated properly.

		   I've tested putting this section in the .text section
		   (argubly where it should belong) but it seems it doesn't get
		   relocated correctly if I place it in that section either.

		   See the README in shared_library_test for more info
